## Firebase Integration

### Database Configuration
- **Database URL**: `https://<your-firebase-project-name>default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/`
- **API Key**: `AIzaS***************************`
- **Real-time Data**: Articles are fetched from Firebase Realtime Database
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/articles` handles server-side data fetching

### Data Structure
The Firebase database expects articles with the following structure:
```json
{
  "articles": {
    "article_id_1": {
      "title": "Article Title",
      "abstract": "Article abstract content",
      "link": "https://example.com/article",
      "graphical_abstract_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
      "similar_articles": "url1,url2,url3",
      "year": 2023,
      "category": "Plant Biology",
      "author": "Dr. Name"
    }
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/articles
Fetches articles from Firebase Realtime Database with optional filtering.

**Query Parameters:**
- `search`: Search term for title and abstract
- `category`: Filter by category
- `author`: Filter by author
- `yearMin`: Minimum year filter
- `yearMax`: Maximum year filter

**Response:**
```json
{
  "articles": [...],
  "total": 10,
  "message": "Articles fetched successfully"
}
```

## Getting Started

1. The application is already running on `http://localhost:3000`
2. Articles are automatically loaded from Firebase on page load
3. Try searching for terms like:
   - "plant growth"
   - "muscle atrophy"
   - "radiation exposure"
   - "bone density"
   - "photosynthesis"

4. Use the filtering system:
   - Click "Show Filters" to display filtering options
   - Select a category to filter by research topic
   - Choose an author to see their publications
   - Use the year range slider to filter by publication date
   - Combine multiple filters for precise results
   - Click "Clear All" to reset all filters

## Data Loading

### Initial Load
